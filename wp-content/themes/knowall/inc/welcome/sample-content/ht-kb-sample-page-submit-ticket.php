<strong>Add a form to this page to link your support ticketing system</strong>

With KnowAll, when a customer gets stuck they can click on a link, right on the knowledge base article they are viewing and submit a ticket via your site (using a page like this with a form on it) or connect to an external ticketing system.

Forms can be created with a form plugin such as Gravity Forms. KnowAll Pro includes a Gravity Forms integration which allows you to require visitors to search your knowledge base before submitting a form, useful for helping to reduce support requests. 

KnowAll tracks where your customers are getting stuck and hitting the Support link, allowing you to monitor and improve your online documentation and support. It helps reduce support tickets and have happier customers.

It works with most popular ticketing systems such as Help Scout and Zendesk, if you want to learn more, check out the HeroThemes blog to find out how easy it is to integrate your knowledge base and ticketing system with KnowAll.
